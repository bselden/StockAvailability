"Archive.csv" contains all data necessary to replicate the analysis.

Archive.csv contains the following seven columns:
1. "Trawl.Identifier" -- this is unique ID associated with each bottom trawl tow (BS Note: Appears to be HAULJOIN in triennial survey and trawl_id in annual)
2. "Year" -- this is the calendar year associated with a tow
3. "Longitude" -- longitude for the centroid of a trawl tow
4. "Latitude" -- latitude for the centroid of a trawl tow
5. "Survey" -- factor indicating whether the tow was conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Sciece Center "triennial" shelf survey ("Tri.Shelf") or the Northwest Fisheries Science Center "annual" combined shelf-slope survey ("WCGBTS")
6. "Numerical_calendar_date" -- Numerical calendar date, where Jan. 1 is indicated by a 1
7. "Catch_KG" -- The catch in kilograms for a given tow
8. "AreaSwept_km2" -- this is the area swept by a tow (in square kilometers), calculated as the product of trawl tow distance and average width of trawl tow
9.  "Species" -- factor indicating which species is associated with Catch_KG for a given level of Trawl.Identifier

These data are publicly available from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (National Marine Fisheries Service, NOAA), a laboratory of the US Federal Government.  The data are publicly available online (https://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/) and we recommend that future analyses obtain up-to-date data.  

In particular, the data archived here represent a spatial subset of available data and a limited number of species, as explained in Thorson Pinsky Ward (In press).

The triennial survey was conducted by many scientists from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center.  We recommend reading:
